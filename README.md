# Epigenetic-modification-and-Parkinson-s-disease
## Introduction :
## Description and literature : 
### In this study, we analyzed a chemically induced Parkinson’s disease (PD) mouse model. Multi-omics approaches including RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, scRNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics were utilized to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of PD and to support the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Additionally, we performed LC-MS/MS–based proteomic analyses on adult human neurons differentiated from human neural stem cells, maintained under both 2D and 3D optimized culture conditions.


## Data : 
### The dataset was generated by Stand Up Therapeutics Co., Ltd. in collaboration with Seoul National University, which conducted the proteomic analyses. The dataset includes multi-omics data (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, scRNA-seq, and spatial transcriptomics) obtained from the chemically induced mouse PD model. Additionally, it includes proteomics data derived from 2D and 3D cultured human neurons. All data are provided in CSV format.
